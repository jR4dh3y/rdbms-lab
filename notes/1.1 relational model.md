# Relational Model given by E.F. Codd in 1970

### basic structure 
- formally, given sents d1,d2,d3,...,dn a relation r is subset of d1 x d2 x ... x dn. thus, a relation is a set of n-tuples (a1, a2, ... ,an) where Ai belongs to Di
- a relation is a subset of the cartesian product of its domains


### Attribute type
- each attribute of a relation has a name 
- the set of allowed vakeus for each attributes is called the domain of the attribute
- attributes values are required to be atomic
- domain is said to be atomic if all its membersa are atomic 
- the spicial value null is a member of every domain 
- the null value causes complications in the definition of many operations

### Relation Schema
- A1,A2,...An are attributes
- R = (A1,A2,...An) is a relation schema 
- r(R) denotes a relation r on the relation schema R

### Relation Instance 
- the current values (relation instance) of a relation are specified by a table 
- an element t of r is a tuple, represented by a row in a table

### Relation are Unordered
- order of tuples in a relation is not important

### Database 
- a database consists of multiple relations
- information ablout a relation is broken into parts, with each relation storing a part of the information
- storing all information as a singke relation results in 
    1. repetition of data
    2. need for null values
- normalization theory deals with the problem of how to break a relation into smaller relations

### Keys
- let K be a subset of the attributes of relation R
- K is a superkey of R if values for K are sufficient to identify a unique tuple of each possible relation instance r(R)
- if K is a superkey and no proper subset of K is a superkey, then K is a minimal super key or candidate key
        or 
- K is a candidate key if K is minimal
- primary key: a candidate key chosen to be the principal means of identifying tuples in a relation

### Foreign Key
- A relation schema may have an attribute that corresponds to the primary key of another relation

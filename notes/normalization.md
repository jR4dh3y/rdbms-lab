## Normalization in rdbms 

- Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. The main goals of normalization are to eliminate duplicate data, ensure data dependencies make sense, and simplify the structure of the database.
- Normalization typically involves dividing a database into two or more tables and defining relationships between the tables. The process is usually carried out in stages, known as normal forms, each with its own set of rules and requirements.
